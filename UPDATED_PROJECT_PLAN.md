# Genomic Sparse Attention: Updated Hybrid Project Plan

## Executive Summary
This project uses a three-phase hybrid approach to validate sparse attention mechanisms and task-specific learning on genomic regulatory prediction. By comparing traditional attention, sparse approximation, and joint pipeline training, we'll definitively determine which approach is superior for genomic AI.

## Three-Phase Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Traditional Attention Baseline (Week 1)
**Objective**: Establish traditional attention performance and extract ground truth

**Steps**:
1. **Train Standard Genomic Attention Model**
   - Full attention mechanism on regulatory prediction
   - Use synthetic data with planted regulatory motifs
   - Extract attention head outputs as reference "ground truth"
   - Document performance, computational cost, interpretability

2. **Validate Attention Quality** 
   - Verify attention heads identify planted regulatory motifs
   - Establish baseline accuracy and computational requirements
   - Create visualization of attention patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Traditional attention achieves >80% accuracy on synthetic data
- [ ] Attention patterns correspond to planted motifs (visual validation)
- [ ] Computational baseline established (FLOPs, memory usage)

**Outputs**:
- Trained traditional attention model
- Attention head outputs as ground truth dataset
- Performance baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Sparse Approximation Validation (Week 2)
**Objective**: Prove sparse attention can replicate traditional attention with 95% computational savings

**Steps**:
1. **Train Sparse Approximator**
   - Use Phase 1 attention outputs as ground truth
   - Train sparse MLP approximator with learned token selection
   - Test sparsity ratios: 5%, 10%, 20%
   - Implement bottleneck filtering (noise reduction)

2. **Validate 95% Noise Hypothesis**
   - Compare sparse approximation accuracy vs. full attention
   - Measure computational savings
   - Analyze which tokens get selected (should match regulatory motifs)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 5-10% sparse attention achieves ≥95% of full attention accuracy
- [ ] 90-95% computational reduction demonstrated
- [ ] Selected positions overlap with regulatory motifs (statistical significance p < 0.01)

**Outputs**:
- Validated sparse attention models
- Proof of 95% computational noise hypothesis
- Token selection interpretability analysis

### Phase 3: Joint Pipeline Training Comparison (Week 3)
**Objective**: Test if task-specific learning outperforms traditional attention

**Steps**:
1. **Train Joint Pipeline Model**
   - Task-specific embeddings with differential learning rates
   - Direct optimization for regulatory prediction (no attention intermediate)
   - Same synthetic datasets as Phase 1 & 2

2. **Head-to-Head Comparison**
   - Compare joint pipeline vs. traditional attention accuracy
   - Compare computational efficiency
   - Compare biological interpretability

3. **Determine Superior Approach**
   - Statistical comparison of performance
   - Analysis of which approach learns better representations
   - Establish new "ground truth" if joint pipeline superior

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Joint pipeline training completes successfully with differential learning rates
- [ ] Statistical comparison completed (p-values, confidence intervals)
- [ ] Superior approach identified with evidence

**Possible Outcomes**:
- **Traditional wins**: Sparse attention is main contribution (95% computational savings)
- **Joint pipeline wins**: Task-specific learning is superior + sparse approximation of that
- **Equivalent**: Both approaches valid, choose based on use case

### Phase 4: Real Data Validation (Week 4)
**Objective**: Validate best approach on real genomic data

**Steps**:
1. **Apply Best Approach to Real Data**
   - Use EPD promoter sequences and ENCODE enhancer data
   - Train winning approach from Phase 3
   - Compare against literature baselines

2. **Biological Validation**
   - Motif enrichment analysis of selected positions
   - Compare with known transcription factor binding sites
   - Validate biological interpretability claims

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Real data performance matches synthetic validation
- [ ] Biological interpretability confirmed (known motifs discovered)
- [ ] Results suitable for publication/collaboration
