# Genomic Sparse Attention: Project Plan

## Executive Summary
This project validates sparse attention mechanisms on genomic regulatory element prediction, testing the hypothesis that most DNA sequence interactions are computational noise. We aim to demonstrate that 5-10% sparse attention can achieve equivalent performance to full attention while providing massive computational savings, specifically for genomic AI applications.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objective
Demonstrate that sparse attention with learned token selection can effectively predict regulatory element activity from DNA sequences using only 5-10% of sequence positions, validating the "disambiguation hypothesis" for genomic data.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Prove task-specific embeddings outperform generic nucleotide representations
2. Show computational efficiency gains (95% reduction in attention computation)
3. Validate biological interpretability (selected positions correspond to known regulatory motifs)
4. Establish foundation for full-genome sparse attention architectures

## Scientific Hypotheses

### Core Hypothesis
Most nucleotide-nucleotide interactions in genomic sequences represent computational noise; only a small subset of positions (regulatory elements) require attention for accurate regulatory prediction.

### Supporting Hypotheses
1. **Sparse Selection Hypothesis**: Learned token selection will identify biologically meaningful regulatory motifs
2. **Task-Specific Learning Hypothesis**: Embeddings learned directly for regulatory prediction will outperform generic nucleotide encodings
3. **Efficiency Hypothesis**: 5-10% sparse attention will achieve >95% of full attention performance with 95% computational savings

## Technical Architecture

### Model Components

#### 1. Token Selection Organ (Pipeline Organ)
- **Function**: Identify most relevant nucleotide positions for regulatory prediction
- **Input**: Nucleotide sequence embeddings (sequence_length × embed_dim)
- **Output**: Relevance scores (sequence_length × 1)
- **Architecture**: 
  ```
  Input: 16D nucleotide embeddings
  Hidden: 8D with ReLU
  Output: 1D relevance score
  ```

#### 2. Attention Approximation Organ (Terminating Organ)
- **Function**: Predict regulatory strength using selected positions
- **Input**: Concatenated [query, key, value] for selected positions
- **Output**: Regulatory strength prediction
- **Architecture**:
  ```
  Input: 48D (16×3 concatenated Q,K,V)
  Hidden: 8D bottleneck with ReLU (noise filtering)
  Output: 1D regulatory strength
  ```

#### 3. Task-Specific Embeddings
- **Function**: Learn nucleotide representations optimized for regulatory prediction
- **Vocabulary**: {A, T, C, G, N, PAD} = 6 tokens
- **Dimensions**: 16D embeddings
- **Learning Rate**: 5× higher than task layers (differential learning)

### Artificial Organism Implementation
Following the artificial organism model from the attention paper:
- **Functional Modularity**: Distinct token selection and prediction organs
- **Local Objectives**: Each organ optimized for its specialized function
- **Global Objective**: Minimize regulatory prediction error
- **End-to-end Training**: Gradient flow enables co-adaptation

## Experimental Design

#### Validation Metrics
1. **Attention Accuracy**: Do selected positions overlap with planted motifs?
